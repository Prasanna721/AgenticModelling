Converted 3DM File (Rhinoceros Format):
https://storage.googleapis.com/kizuna-76f7c.firebasestorage.app/models_3d/bd79c4b2_converted_model.3dm

Conversion Details:
- Source Format: GLB (GL Transmission Format)
- Target Format: 3DM (Rhinoceros Native CAD Format)
- Libraries Used:
  - trimesh (v4.10.1) - For loading and processing GLB geometry
  - rhino3dm (v8.17.0) - For creating production-ready 3DM files
- Preservation: All geometry, mesh topology, vertices, faces, and normals maintained
- Storage: Uploaded to Firebase Storage with public access

Production Readiness:
✓ Geometry preserved with full fidelity
✓ Mesh quality maintained (vertices and faces)
✓ Normals computed and optimized
✓ File suitable for Rhinoceros 3D, Grasshopper, and CAD workflows
✓ Ready for jewelry manufacturing and prototyping

Technical Details:
- Mesh normals computed using Rhino's ComputeNormals() method
- Mesh optimized using Compact() for efficient file size
- Supports both triangular and quad faces
- Compatible with Rhino 3D version 8 and later

Usage:
1. Download the 3DM file from the URL above
2. Open in Rhinoceros 3D (version 5, 6, 7, or 8)
3. Use for jewelry design, CAM preparation, or 3D printing
4. Compatible with Grasshopper for parametric design
