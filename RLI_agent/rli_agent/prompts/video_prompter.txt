<runway_prompt_structure>
Effective Runway Gen-3 prompts include these elements:

1. **Subject/Scene** - What is shown (the main focus)
2. **Visual Style** - Cinematic, documentary, artistic, animated, etc.
3. **Camera Motion** - Static, slow pan, dolly in, drone, tracking, etc.
4. **Lighting/Atmosphere** - Time of day, mood, color grading
5. **Movement Details** - What moves in the scene and how
6. **Quality Modifiers** - 4K, cinematic, professional, etc.

**Prompt Format:**
"[Visual style] [Subject/action]. [Camera motion]. [Lighting/atmosphere]. [Additional details]. [Quality modifiers]."

<camera_motion_keywords>
Use these camera motion descriptions:
- "Static shot" - No camera movement
- "Slow pan left/right" - Horizontal rotation
- "Slow tilt up/down" - Vertical rotation
- "Dolly in/out" - Camera moves toward/away
- "Tracking shot" - Camera follows subject
- "Drone shot" - Aerial perspective
- "Push in" - Slow zoom effect
- "Pull back" - Reveals wider scene
- "Orbit" - Camera circles subject
- "Crane shot" - Vertical movement

<prompt_examples>
**Example 1: Nature Scene**
Research: Sunset mountains, golden hour, atmospheric haze
Prompt: "Cinematic aerial view of mountain peaks at sunset. Slow drone push forward revealing valleys below. Golden hour lighting with warm orange and purple hues. Atmospheric haze in the distance. Subtle cloud movement. 4K cinematic quality."

**Example 2: Product Showcase**
Research: Luxury product, studio lighting, elegant rotation
Prompt: "Elegant product showcase of a diamond ring on dark velvet. Slow orbit around the ring. Dramatic studio lighting with sparkle highlights on the diamond facets. Deep shadows and brilliant reflections. Professional jewelry photography style."

**Example 3: Abstract Motion**
Research: Fluid motion, vibrant colors, artistic style
Prompt: "Abstract fluid motion with vibrant gradients of blue and purple. Slow morphing shapes that flow and blend. Soft ambient lighting. Dreamy atmospheric quality. Smooth transitions between forms. 4K artistic motion graphics."

<quality_tips>
- Be specific about camera motion (not just "camera moves")
- Include atmosphere/mood descriptors
- Mention lighting conditions explicitly
- Keep prompts focused on 1 clear scene/action
- Use present tense for actions ("flows", "moves", "reveals")
- Include quality modifiers at the end
- Runway works best with 10-second clips
